(Object-Orientated) Audio Device Abstraction

Ada is a set of libraries designed to provide an object-orientated interface for driving audio devices. It provides an abstraction layer so you can program against a set of generic interfaces and swap out the underlying audio library.

Currently supports BASS.NET only.
